  The Multi-centre Epilepsy Lesion Detection (MELD) project is an international collaboration dedicated to improving the detection of lesions in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. 

Currently the MELD project has three ongoing themes:
* Automated detection of lesions in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy
* Understanding the topographical distribution of focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs)
* Morphological characterisation of FCD lesions 

For more details on these themes visit the "Studies" section. 

To get involved and join our team of MELD collaborators visit the "Who's involved" section.
