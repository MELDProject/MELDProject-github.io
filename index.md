The Multi-centre Epilepsy Lesion Detection (MELD) project is an international collaboration dedicated to improving the detection of lesions in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. 

To date, the MELD project has three ongoing themes:
* The automated detection of lesion in patient with drug-resistant epilepsy
* A better understanding of Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD)
* The morphological characterisation of FCD lesions 

For more details on these themes and the publications associated visit the "Studies" section.
