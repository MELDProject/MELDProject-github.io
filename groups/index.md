title: Who's involved in the MELD Project
excerpt: "Members of the MELD Project"
---

Sophie Adler and Konrad Wagstyl set up the MELD Project. 

Sophie is a MBPhD student from University College London who completed a PhD on cortical morphometry and MR signal intensity analysis in paediatric epilepsy. Konrad Wagstyl is a MBPhD student from the University of Cambridge who completed a PhD on deep learning and cortical structure. This project is supervised by Professor Torsten Baldeweg from the Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health.

The MELD project is a subgroup of ENIGMA-epilepsy and we work closely with Professor Sanjay Sisodiya and Dr. Christopher D. Whelan. 

Dr. Kirstie Whitaker from the Alan Turing Institute is our advisor on open, robust and generalisable science. 

A number of centres world-wide are using the automated FCD detection [code](https://github.com/kwagstyl/FCDdetection) that is freely available to download. We are also collaborating with interested groups to build robust and generalisable tools.

### Groups involved in the multi-centre collaboration

We are delighted that a number of different groups have joined our multi-centre collaboration.

### Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), UK
GOSH is a leading centre in paediatric epilepsy surgery in Europe. It has had a programme for surgery for treating epilepsy in children since 1992. We are working with clinicians such as Professor Helen Cross and Dr Roxana Gunny as well as researchers such as Dr David Carmichael and Dr Sara Lorio.

### Cleveland Clinic, USA
We are working with Dr Irene Wang's group at the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, USA. This is one of the largest epilepsy programmes in the world treating both adults and children.  

### National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UK
The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery has the largest adult epilepsy surgery programme in the UK. The Epilepsy Imaging Group of the UCL Institute of Neurology has a long history of developing imaging techniques to improve surgical treatment for patients with epilepsy. We are working with Dr Gavin Winston's group.

### Greifswald Epilepsy Center, Germany
The Greifswald Epilepsy Center is part of the Neurological Department at the University Medicine of Greifswald with a long tradition since 1974. Presurgical diagnostic work-up in epilepsy patients has been performed since 1994. More than 2000 patients (adults and children) per year with epilepsy are treated in its outpatient clinic. We work with Dr. Felix von Podewils and Dr. Bernadette Gaida.

### Hospital Del Mar, Spain
We work with the neuroradiologist  Dr Sofia Gonzalez-Ortiz at the Hospital Del Mar in Barcelona, Spain. The mission of the Epilepsy Unit, of the Hospital del Mar,  lead by Dr. Rodrigo R. Rocamora, is to be a national reference in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy throughout all ages of patients’ life.

### Gaslini Institute, Genova, Italy
G. Gaslini Institute is a paediatric hospital based in Genova and is a national reference in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy and other neurodevelopmental diseases. There is a dedicated programme of research into epilepsy genetics and clinical management of the patients, including a programme for surgery. 

### Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Spain
The Epilepsy Unit of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona  is a reference center of epilepsy surgery in Spain.  From the Hospital Clínic we coordinate the Functional Unit of Epilepsy Surgery of Catalonia and we are also accredited by the Ministry of Health to evaluate patients referred from other autonomous communities that do not have this program. Since the creation of the Unit, we have evaluated more than 1,500 patients with refractory epilepsy and we have operated on more than 400 patients. One of our research lines are the utility of neuroimaging techniques, in helping to detect the epileptogenic focus. The head of the Epilepsy Unit is Dr Marr Carreño and the lead of the imaging group in Dra Nuria Bargalló.

### Institute of Neurology at University Magna Graecia, Italy
The Institute of Neurology at University Magna Graecia in Catanzaro hosts a reference Epilepsy Center in Southern Italy. The research Unit, led by Prof. Antonio Gambardella and Prof. Angelo Labate, closely collaborates with the Neuroscience Research Center of University Magna Graecia and with the Institute of Molecular Bioimaging and Physiology of the National Research Council, both located in Catanzaro. In this setting, neurologists, neuropsychologists, biologists and neuroimaging experts collaborate to carry on multimodal research on epileptic syndromes, especially on Mild and refractory Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.

### UNICAMP Epilepsy Surgery Programme and Laboratory of Neuroimaging, Brazil
The Epilepsy Imaging research team, coordinated by Prof. Fernando Cendes, is based on the Laboratory of Neuroimaging associate to the Department of Neurology of the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil. This lab provides conditions to evaluate and quantify structural and metabolic alterations of the CNS, using various techniques of MRI, for both imaging acquisition and postprocessing techniques of high complexity, and development of new tools and software for better evaluation of neuroimaging data. The Neuroimaging group at UNICAMP is inserted into one of the FAPESP Programs of Research and Innovation, The Brazilian Research Institute for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology (BRAINN http://cepid.fapesp.br/en/centro/11) with several projects funded, including undergraduate students, master's, doctoral and postdoctoral studies. 

### The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Melbourne, Australia
The Florey's Epilepsy division is a world-leading centre for epilepsy research. The division has major groups at both the Florey’s Austin and Parkville campus. The group studies mechanisms that cause epilepsy from the level of cells to the function of the whole brain. We use technologies including advanced MRI and cutting edge cellular physiology techniques to allow us to understand genetic and acquired mechanisms that give rise to epilepsy. 

### Epilepsy and Neuropharmacology Research Group, Melbourne, Australia
The Research of the Epilepsy and Neuropharmacology Research Group is broad based, covering both basic and clinical studies relevant to epilepsy and related areas, including traumatic brain injury and dementing disorders.
