title: Who's involved in the MELD Project
excerpt: "Members of the MELD Project"
---

Sophie Adler and Konrad Wagstyl set up the MELD Project. 

Sophie is a MBPhD student from University College London who completed a PhD on cortical morphometry and MR signal intensity analysis in paediatric epilepsy. Konrad Wagstyl is a MBPhD student from the University of Cambridge who completed a PhD on deep learning and cortical structure. This project is supervised by Professor Torsten Baldeweg from the Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health.

The MELD project is a subgroup of ENIGMA-epilepsy and we work closely with Professor Sanjay Sisodiya and Dr. Christopher D. Whelan. 

Dr. Kirstie Whitaker from the Alan Turing Institute is our advisor on open, robust and generalisable science. 

A number of centres world-wide are using the automated FCD detection [code](https://github.com/kwagstyl/FCDdetection) that is freely available to download. We are also collaborating with interested groups to build robust and generalisable tools.

### Groups involved in the multi-centre collaboration

We are delighted that a number of different groups have joined our multi-centre collaboration.

### Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH)
GOSH is a leading centre in paediatric epilepsy surgery in Europe. It has had a programme for surgery for treating epilepsy in children since 1992. We are working with clinicians such as Professor Helen Cross and Dr Roxana Gunny as well as researchers such as Dr David Carmichael and Dr Sara Lorio.

### Cleveland Clinic 
We are working with Dr Irene Wang's group at the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, USA. This is one of the largest epilepsy programmes in the world treating both adults and children.  

### National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery
The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery has the largest adult epilepsy surgery programme in the UK. The Epilepsy Imaging Group of the UCL Institute of Neurology has a long history of developing imaging techniques to improve surgical treatment for patients with epilepsy. We are working with Dr Gavin Winston's group.

### Greifswald Epilepsy Center
The Greifswald Epilepsy Center is part of the Neurological Department at the University Medicine of Greifswald with a long tradition since 1974. Presurgical diagnostic work-up in epilepsy patients has been performed since 1994. More than 2000 patients (adults and children) per year with epilepsy are treated in its outpatient clinic. We work with Dr. Felix von Podewils and Dr. Bernadette Gaida.

### Hospital Del Mar
We work with Dr Sofia Gonzalez-Ortiz at the Hospital Del Mar in Barcelona, Spain. The mission of the Epilepsy Unit of the Hospital del Mar is to be a national reference in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy throughout all ages of patients' life.

### Gaslini Institute, Genova, Italy
G. Gaslini Institute is a paediatric hospital based in Genova and is a national reference in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy and other neurodevelopmental diseases. There is a dedicated programme of research into epilepsy genetics and clinical management of the patients, including a programme for surgery.
