### Automated Detection of Focal Cortical Dysplasias

Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a congenital abnormality of cortical development and a leading cause of surgically remediable drug resistant epilepsy. MRI has played a major role in the evaluation of patients; yet, significant proportions of lesions remain undetected by conventional image analysis. Machine learning offers a powerful framework to develop automated and individualised clinical tools that may improve the detection of lesions and prediction of clinically relevant outcome.

In work [published in Neuroimage: Clinical](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158216302674?via%3Dihub) in 2017, Adler, Wagstyl et al., developed a classifier using surface-based features to identify focal abnormalities of cortical development in a paediatric cohort. Focal cortical dysplasias in this paediatric cohort were correctly identified in 73% of the children.

White circle on T1 and FLAIR images indicates lesion location. Third column: Neural network classifier output (yellow) and manual lesion mask (light blue) viewed on pial surface, for large lesions, or inflated surface, for small lesions buried in sulci.</figcaption>
